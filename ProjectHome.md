### Better Integration for Spotify into Ubuntu ###

This project uses Spotify linux desktop client's dbus functions in a .desktop file to flesh out ubuntu integration a little bit. Should degrade gracefully on distros that don't use this standard.

Works out of the box for Ubuntu 12.04+. Also has a version that works with the excellent [spotify-notify](https://code.google.com/p/spotify-notify/) project. spotify-notify will also enable Media Keys!!!
